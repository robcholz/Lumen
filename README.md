## What is Lumen?

Lumen is a desktop-grade hardware interaction node.
It lives on the desktop long-term, can sense state, participate in interaction,
and present and feed back those changes in hardware.

## Why Lumen?

Lumen is designed to stay on your desk every day,
as a hardware presence that keeps evolving with what you do.

If you enjoy projects that connect software with the physical world,
Lumen is built for you.

## Build your own Lumen in under 10 minutes

- Flash firmware directly from your browser
- No local IDE, no toolchain setup
- All builds are produced by CI
- Hardware files are fully open-sourced

👉 Start here: [Quick Start](docs/quick-start.md)

## What people build with Lumen

- A physical Minecraft status display
- A USB-C power monitor that lives on your desk
- A system state notifier (CPU, build, deploy, errors)
- A programmable interaction gadget for games and tools

Lumen is not a single-purpose device —
it’s a hardware base you can repurpose.

## See it in action

When something happens in Minecraft,
your desk reacts in real time — lights, motion, and sound.

## System Architecture Overview

- System integration: Rust no-std
- UI: Vision-UI
- System: FreeRTOS
- Graphics Driver: u8g2
- Hardware
    - Buzzer
    - INA226
    - LSM6DSO
    - ESP32-C3
    - 240x240 display
    - Rotary encoder
    - Power Switch

## Design Notes

### About architecture

- Firmware uses a layered driver structure instead of feature stacking, to speed up development and CI builds.
- UI is independent of top level logic, ensuring interaction changes do not affect core functionality.
- Rust no-std is used only for the system integration layer, not to fully replace C/C++.

### About interaction

- All interactions prioritize "long-term desktop use" rather than debugging convenience.
- UI does not depend on serial output, so the device does not lose value when "detached from the PC".
- Animations and easter eggs are deliberately kept low-frequency to avoid distracting the main function.

### About reproducibility

- All build flows are automated to avoid "author environment" dependency.
- Avoids solutions that require expensive equipment or special tools.
- Explicitly not chasing extreme performance, prioritizing success rate.

### Known limitations

- The web flashing flow depends on browser WebUSB support.
- CI has no cache or diff builds yet, so there is room for speed optimization.
